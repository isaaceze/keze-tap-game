## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Fixes Still Don't Appear:**

**Problem**: Aggressive caching
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Run in browser console:
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
caches.keys().then(names => names.forEach(name => caches.delete(name)));
location.reload(true);
```

**Problem**: Mixed old/new files
**Solution**:
- Completely delete all frontend files
- Re-extract the package
- Verify file timestamps are today

**Problem**: CDN caching
**Solution**:
- Wait 10-15 minutes for CDN refresh
- Or contact Namecheap to flush CDN cache

### **Emergency Verification:**

**Check build ID in your deployed files:**
1. Open deployed `index.html`
2. Look for: `fdpZxX39MzcLHzUk-AEp6`
3. If you see different ID, deployment failed
